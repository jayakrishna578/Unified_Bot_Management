The project will be implemented using Python, Streamlit for the web interface, OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 for the chatbots, and SQLite for the database. The project will be structured as follows:

- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the Streamlit interface and the logic to manage the chatbots.
- `bot.py`: This file will contain the `Bot` class, which will be used to create and manage individual chatbots.
- `database.py`: This file will contain the `Database` class, which will be used to interact with the SQLite database.
- `stock_data_retrieval_bot.py`: This file will contain the `StockDataRetrievalBot` class, which will be used to fetch stock data.
- `query_bot.py`: This file will contain the `QueryBot` class, which will be used to query the database for stock data.

The `requirements.txt` file will contain the list of Python packages required for the project.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file:
